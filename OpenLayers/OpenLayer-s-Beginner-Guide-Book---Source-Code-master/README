# OpenLayers -OpenLayers 2.10 Beginner's Guide #
The aim of this book is to provide a guide for beginners and also serve as a reference (but not a replacement for the OpenLayers docs). We use examples throughout the book to deomstrate OpenLayers concepts. This site will serve as extension for the OpenLayers book and contain code samples, error fixes, and other related things.
